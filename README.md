<h1>About the final project assessment</h1>
<h3>The purpose of the final project assessment</h3>
<p>The main purpose of a graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed.

Most importantly, graded assessments help you to establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before you can complete the course.

Ultimately, this assessment is designed to help you make sure that youâ€™re ready for the next course in this program.
